# ACEworkflows

Workflow Examples for ACE Models. In this repo we will collect example scripts used to fit ACE or related models. Some of these examples should be considered a work in progress. The examples from the article introducing `ACEpotentials.jl` are also published in this repository - see list below.

## List of Examples

- Zuo2020Benchmark : fit the benchmark datasets from (Zuo et al 2020) and compare against, GAP, MTP. 
- TiO2_2016 (WIP) : a first attempt to refit the TiO2 dataset from (Artrith 2016)
