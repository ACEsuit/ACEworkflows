# model degree parameters, make sure those don't change between runs

# this is a bit delicate and should probably be done in a more robust way.

# H bonds are ca 0.1nm = 1A 
# so important bonding happens on quite a large scale. This is a paradigm case 
# for a multi-scale basis, but we don't have time for that now ... Instead we 
# will use an agnesi-2-1, but with custom r0 values that capture the typical 
# lengths of the HH, HO bonds and the average OO distance in water.
