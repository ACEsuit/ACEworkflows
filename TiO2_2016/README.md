This is a semi-failed experiment to match or beat the accuracy of Ngoc Nguyen's results with ACE1x defaults. We can indeed to this but only with a fairly large basis, which is sad. 

Some things to try going forward: 
- play with the csp sparsification parameter (as in @exapde's paper) 
- optimize the radial embedding and try again 
- learn from the Many-body POD idea and build into ACE
