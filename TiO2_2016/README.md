This is a semi-failed experiment to match or beat the accuracy of Ngoc Nguyen's results (cf @exapde) with ACE1x defaults. We can indeed achieve this but only with a fairly large basis, which is sad. Ngoc has done some impressive fine-tuning of the basis and we should explore whether this can be automated. I am therefore keeping this experiment as a record for future attempts to improve on it. 

Some things to try going forward: 
- play with the csp sparsification parameter (as in Ngoc's paper)
- optimize the radial embedding and try again 
- anything to learn from the Many-body POD idea?
